## Windows Setup Instructions (Step-by-Step)

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.10 or higher** installed on your Windows machine
- **Git** installed (download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** access

---

### Step 1: Install Python

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. During installation, **check the box "Add Python to PATH"**
3. Verify installation by opening **Command Prompt** and running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.13.x`

---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**
2. Navigate to where you want to store the project:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   ```
4. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Social-media-addiction\social_addiction
   ```

---

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you see an error about execution policies, run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
   Then try activating again.

3. You should see `(env)` appear at the beginning of your command prompt line.

---

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- Django
- pandas
- plotly
- numpy
- and all other dependencies

---

### Step 5: Set Up the Database

Run Django migrations to set up the SQLite database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Step 6: Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output like:
```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
```

---

### Step 7: Access the Dashboard

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/** or **http://localhost:8000/**
3. You should see the Social Media Addiction Dashboard!

---

## Using the Dashboard

1. **Filter Data**: Use the dropdown menus to filter by:
   - Gender (Male/Female/All)
   - Platform (Instagram/Facebook/Twitter/etc./All)

2. **View Statistics**: Four summary cards show:
   - Average Addiction Score
   - Average Daily Usage Hours
   - Average Sleep Hours
   - Average Mental Health Score

3. **Dataset Preview**: See the first 10 rows of filtered data in a table

4. **Interactive Charts**: Scroll down to view four interactive Plotly charts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "python is not recognized"
**Solution**: Python is not in your PATH. Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Issue: "pip is not recognized"
**Solution**: Try using `python -m pip` instead of `pip`:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Virtual environment won't activate
**Solution**: If using PowerShell, you may need to change the execution policy (see Step 3).

### Issue: Port 8000 already in use
**Solution**: Either:
- Stop the other process using port 8000, or
- Run on a different port:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver 8001
  ```

### Issue: Missing CSV file error
**Solution**: Make sure the dataset file exists at:
```
dashboard/static/dataset/Students Social Media Addiction.csv
```

## Stopping the Server

To stop the development server:
- Press **CTRL + C** in the Command Prompt/PowerShell window

To deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

---

## Notes

- This is a **development server** - not suitable for production
- The dataset is included in the repository
- No database migrations needed (no models defined)
- All data processing happens on-the-fly using pandas

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add data upload functionality
- [ ] Export filtered data to CSV
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Save favorite filter combinations
- [ ] Add more visualization options
- [ ] Implement caching for better performance
